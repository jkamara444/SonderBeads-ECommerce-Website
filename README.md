# SonderBeads-ECommerce-Website
This e-commerce website was developed for my handmade jewelry business, utilizing a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front end. The platform employs Express for the backend, enabling effective management of product listings and user interactions. I integrated Stripe's API to ensure secure payment processing, providing a smooth transaction experience for customers. Although the site is not currently hosted, it was previously online and successfully facilitated e-commerce transactions. Furthermore, this project equipped me with valuable technical skills in web development, and I continue to passionately create and sell my jewelry on a smaller scale!
